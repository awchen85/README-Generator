# <Readme Generator>

## Description

ReadMe Generator will create a professional ReadMe for you, based off of a criteria of questions that you will answer.

- This is intended to streamline the process of ReadMe creation, letting you focus more on your code.
- I learned about chaining functions together with .then, as well as the fact that sometimes, nothing happening is a good thing (no error messages!).

## Requirements

The user will be prompted with a Command Line Interface that accepts user input:

* Prompt the user with questions, used to create the Readme.
* The README.md file most contain: Title of project, sections entitled: 
    * Description
    * Table of Contents
    * Installation
    * Usage
    * License
    * Contribution
    * Tests
    * Questions
* User must be able to select a license from an array of Open Source Licenses, which populates a badge on the README.
* Link users Github account and Email Address
* Link the table of contents to direct the user to the respective section.
